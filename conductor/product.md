# Initial Concept\n\nA personal finance workspace tailored for managing income, spending, and shared budgets across three accounts (you, partner, and joint). The dashboard keeps budgets, recurring obligations, and month-to-month performance together so you can replace manual spreadsheets.

## Product Vision
Balance Beacon aims to demystify household finances for couples and partners by providing a centralized, transparent, and collaborative workspace. It replaces the friction of manual spreadsheets with an automated, intuitive platform that balances individual autonomy with shared financial responsibility.

## Target Audience
The primary users are couples or partners who navigate the complexities of managing shared expenses alongside individual financial lives. It is for those who value clarity, collaboration, and a streamlined approach to budgeting.
