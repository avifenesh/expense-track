# Product Guidelines\n\n## Brand Voice & Tone\n- **Clarity Above All:** Financial data can be overwhelming. Our communication must be direct, jargon-free, and easy to parse at a glance.\n- **Supportive Collaboration:** We are a tool for partnership. The tone should be encouraging and neutral, never judgmental about spending habits.\n- **Empowering Transparency:** Use active voice to describe financial status and actions. Instead of "A budget was exceeded," use "You have exceeded the Joint Grocery budget."\n\n## Visual Identity\n- **Minimalist Precision:** Focus on whitespace, clean typography (sans-serif), and a restrained color palette. Color should be used primarily for meaning (e.g., status indicators) rather than decoration.\n- **Purposeful Iconography:** Use simple, recognizable icons (via Lucide) to categorize transactions and accounts. Avoid visual clutter.\n- **Intentional Density:** Information should be grouped logically. Use cards and subtle borders to separate concerns without creating a "boxed-in" feeling.\n\n## User Experience Principles\n- **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Automate whatever can be safely automated. Permanent templates and monthly rollovers should handle the heavy lifting of data entry.\n- **Zero-Friction Entry:** The process of logging an expense should be as fast as possible, especially on mobile, to encourage real-time tracking.\n- **Contextual Insights:** Don't just show numbers; show what they mean. Progress bars and trend sparklines should provide immediate context without requiring deep analysis.\n- **Collaborative Sync:** Ensure that updates made by one partner are reflected instantly or clearly communicated to the other to maintain a single source of truth.\n\n## Interaction Design\n- **Optimistic UI:** Use subtle transitions and immediate feedback for server actions (like adding a transaction) to make the app feel responsive and reliable.\n- **Safe Destructive Actions:** Archive instead of delete where possible (like categories) to preserve history while keeping the current view clean. Use clear confirmation dialogs for permanent deletions.
