# Balance Beacon

Personal finance workspace tailored for managing income, spending, and shared budgets across three accounts (you, partner, and joint). The dashboard keeps budgets, recurring obligations, and month-to-month performance together so you can replace manual spreadsheets.

## Features

- üîÅ Permanent transaction plans with one-click application into the current month.
- üí∞ Budgets per account & category with live progress and remaining allowances.
- üìà Month-to-month net results, income vs. expense trends, and quick forecasts.
- üìÇ Flexible categories that you can archive/reactivate without losing history.
- üßæ Fast entry forms for expenses and earnings, including recurring flagging.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 13 App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) with Server Actions enabled
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS UI primitives
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) with PostgreSQL (tested against Neon)
- Zod validation on all server mutations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **18.18+** (recommended Node 20 LTS). Server Actions and the Prisma client both require modern Node. Use `nvm`, `fnm`, or Volta to switch locally if needed.
- npm 9+ (ships with current Node). Yarn/pnpm work too if you prefer.
- A PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, Render, or local Postgres all work).

## Local Setup

### Quick start

```bash
npm run setup:local
```

The script installs dependencies (if needed), writes `.env` with local defaults, boots the Dockerized Postgres instance, syncs Prisma schema, and seeds starter data. When it completes, start the dev server with `npm run dev` (the database stays running).

### Manual steps

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Replace `DATABASE_URL` with your Postgres connection string (Neon will give you one that already includes `sslmode=require`).
   - Set a long, random `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` (use `openssl rand -hex 32`).
   - Optionally set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for absolute URLs in emails/links.

3. **Start a local Postgres instance (optional)**
   If you don‚Äôt already have Postgres running, the repo ships with a Docker compose file:
   ```bash
   npm run db:up:local
   # follow logs (Ctrl+C to detach)
   npm run db:logs:local
   ```
   Credentials default to `postgres:postgres` with the database `expense_track`. Adjust `.env.docker` if you need different values.

4. **Prepare the database schema**
   Choose one of:
   - Use migrations (recommended once you have a persistent DB):
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev --name init
     ```
   - For a throwaway dev database, push the schema directly:
     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```

5. **Seed core data** (creates the three base accounts and starter categories):
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

6. **Generate the Prisma client** (runs automatically on `npm install`, but kept for completeness):
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   ```

7. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or run everything (boot Postgres + dev server) in one go:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:local
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the dashboard.

8. **Stop the local database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:down:local
   ```

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push this repository to GitHub/GitLab.
2. In Vercel, import the project and choose the `main` branch (App Router detected automatically).
3. Add the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` ‚Äì your production Postgres URL (Neon free tier works great).
   - `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` ‚Äì same random 64-char string you used locally.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` ‚Äì e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`.
4. (Optional) Wire up a [Vercel Postgres or Neon integration](https://vercel.com/integrations) for managed credentials.
5. Trigger a production deploy. The build runs `npm run build`, which executes `prisma generate` automatically (see `package.json`).

Detailed, step-by-step notes live in [`docs/vercel-deployment.md`](docs/vercel-deployment.md).

## Database Model

- **Account** ‚Äì You, Partner, Joint (seeded) plus optional extras; used for filtering and budgeting.
- **Category** ‚Äì Income or Expense groupings, soft-archived when no longer needed.
- **Transaction** ‚Äì Individual earnings/expenses with month snapshots and optional recurring linkage.
- **Budget** ‚Äì Planned spend/earn for a category + account in a given month.
- **RecurringTemplate** ‚Äì Permanent plan definitions that can be applied into transactions each month.

## Common Workflows

- Add budgets for the month from the ‚ÄúMonthly Budgets‚Äù card, then capture spending as it happens.
- Save rent/salary/etc. as permanent plans. At the start of each month, hit ‚ÄúApply to {Month}‚Äù to pre-populate them.
- Switch between **All**, **Me**, **Partner**, and **Joint** using the account selector to focus on one ledger.

## Scripts Reference

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build with type-checking |
| `npm run start` | Start the compiled production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run prisma:generate` | Regenerate Prisma client types |
| `npm run db:push` | Push Prisma schema to the configured database |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations in production environments |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed baseline accounts and categories |

## Next Steps & Ideas

- Add authentication if you plan to expose this beyond personal use.
- Attach receipt uploads to transactions (S3, Cloudinary, etc.).
- Create analytics widgets (cash flow by quarter, partner split, etc.).
- Automate monthly rollovers that duplicate all active recurring templates automatically on the 1st.
